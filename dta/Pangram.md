Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs” appears. Just more Beagle Brothers zaniness, I thought. Years later, I realized what this phrase actually is.

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

Short pangrams

## Short pangrams 

in English are more difficult to devise and tend to use uncommon words and unnatural sentences. Longer pangrams afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.

The following are examples of pangrams that are shorter than "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" (which has 35 letters) and use standard written English without abbreviations or proper nouns:

    "Quick nymph bugs vex fjord waltz." (27 letters)
    "Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex." (28 letters)[3]
    "Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf." (28 letters)[2]
    "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow." (29 letters)[4]
    "How quickly daft jumping zebras vex!" (30 letters)[3]
    "The five boxing wizards jump quickly." (31 letters)[3]
    "Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz." (31 letters)[3]
    "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs." (32 letters)[3]


## Perfect pangrams

A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet. 
The only known perfect pangrams of the English alphabet use abbreviations or other non-dictionary words, such as:

-  "Blowzy night-frumps vex'd Jack Q." or 
- "Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx."

[3] or they include words so obscure that the phrase is challenging to understand, such as:

 - "Cwm fjord-bank glyphs vext quiz",[3] in which cwm is a loan word from the Welsh language meaning an amphitheatre-like glaciated depression, vext is an uncommon way to spell vexed, and quiz is used in an archaic sense to mean a puzzling or eccentric person. It means that symbols in the bowl-like depression on the edge of a long steep sea inlet confused an eccentric person.

Other writing systems may present more options: The Iroha is a well-known perfect pangram of the Japanese syllabary, while the Hanacaraka is a perfect pangram for the Javanese script and is commonly used to order its letters in sequence.
